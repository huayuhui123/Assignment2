# Assignment 2: Album Tracker 2.0 by YOURNAME

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own assignment details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  More than ten day's spare time after class.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
...I solved many problems successfully. Some of these problems can take me much time to think,and they are deep in my mind.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
...When I am trying to add error checker(try:...expection)to practice,i find there are not many places can apply.
They may be used more in kivy program.I didn't learn how to use iteration,otherwise the list of albumcollection
can be print in string instead of address.When I push some codes,there are some problems on Github because I defined 
too much romotes and add them to prac8_feedback tolerantly.So I should change them.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
...Githubï¼Œbecause I can check my codes on it and compare,rewiew my process.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
...I think I should make good use of my time and contribute them correctly,and i will try to use more methods.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
...Almost all of these PPTs,but mainly lists,files,class,more on classes.I reviewed them and try to apply some methods on them.
It's very effective.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
... I think to make them into a list and use them is most difficult because there are too many rules.At first,I always print fail and 
find all kinds of mistakes of output while testing them,such as printing too many commas,changing lines into one line.
But I think there must be something to solve them,so I tried and read ppts again and again.
Finally,they are solved and can be printed perfectly.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
...A class is a collection of objects that have the same properties and methods.  It defines the properties and methods 
that are common to each object in the collection.  An object is an instance of a class.  When you are using classes,you 
should add some functions.The most fundamental are init and str.When you add init function,you should define their
attributes and initialze objects.In str fuction,you must return a string.If you want to inherit or use other classes,you can
 import them,and then you can apply these fuctions in father classes conveniently.
